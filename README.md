# RCTrandomiser
My first application, getting familiar with Ruby and Sinatra. The ultimate goal is to support running of Nesta random coffee trials in the workplace by allowing the user to input a list of names, have them randomised into pairings (with previous pairings excluded), and allowing the user to download the list.

The two CSV files are made up of randomly generated names, courtesy of http://listofrandomnames.com/
