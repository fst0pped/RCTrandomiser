# RCTrandomiser
My first application, getting familiar with Ruby and Sinatra. The ultimate goal is to support running of Nesta random coffee trials in the workplace by allowing the user to input a list of names, have them randomised into pairings (with previous pairings excluded), and allowing the user to download the list.

###Features still to add
- Download .csv files of members/exclusions/pairings
- Remove list items (all lists)
- Disable/re-enable members without deleting (e.g. "I'm on holiday this week, can I skip this session?")
- Rewrite error messages so they are handled consistently
- Style and layout (including layout template for header information)

###Stretch features
- 'Undo' functionality?

###Really stretchy features
- Database back end and login

The CSV files are made up of randomly generated names, courtesy of http://listofrandomnames.com/
